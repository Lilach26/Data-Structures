# Data-Structures
My own implementations for every data structures that exists.

Every data structures (in many forms and any kind) will be written in Java, at environment Intellij IDEA, as regular console applications.
The data structures will also be implemented as generics.

Also, there is another folder of "System Design Scenarios", in which I'll use different data structures to design solution for many problems, and explain the logic behind choosing the best data structures for each scenario.
