# Data-Structures
My own implementations for every data structures that exists.

Every data structures (in many forms and any kind) will be written in Java, at environment Intellij IDEA, as regular console applications.
The data structures will also be implemented as generics.

Also, there is another code of in which I'll use different data structures to design special data structures (such as lru cache, MinStack, etc).
